**ii. Timed Mode:** The goal of this game mode is to achieve the highest score possible. Collect the gems and cross the road to score points. Avoid touching the bugs as they decrease your score! Point values:

- _Blue gem:_ 5 points
- _Green gem:_ 10 points
- _Orange gem:_ 25 points
- _Crossing the road:_ 15 points
- _Touching bug:_ -10 points
